        <div class="advice">
            <h4>Small details matter...<strong>A LOT!</strong></h4>

            <p>Pay attention to the details, especially when your code is not working like you think it should. When it
                comes to styling your HTML, if nothing you are doing in CSS is changing <em>anything</em> on your page,
                your CSS and HTML selector names probably don't match. For instance, in your HTML, one of your selectors
                may be <strong>skill</strong> list. Then in your CSS, you may have accidentally made the selector
                <strong>skill<em>s</em></strong> list. Small errors in your selector names will prevent your HTML and
                CSS from communicating and your wonderful CSS code will not work.
            </p>

            <h4>Don't be afraid to ask questions...<em>I should have!</em></h4>

            <p>The previous advice was hard learned by me. It took me a long time to figure it out. I became very
                frustrated and discouraged. I should have asked for help. <em>Don't be like me.</em> If you have checked
                everything, verified your code, and run through all your steps and something is still not working, <strong>ask!</strong>
            </p>
