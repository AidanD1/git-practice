                <h4>Believe in Yourself!</h4>
                <p>This most likely all new for you and you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Believe that you CAN do this...because YOU ARE CAPABLE.</p>

                <h4>Trust the process.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning! Trust that it will all make sense when you see each small win...they WILL add up
                    to progress, so just keep learning!</p>
